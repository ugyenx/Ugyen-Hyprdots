# 🌸 Ugyen-Hyprdots ～ ✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*

A pastel-themed collection of my **Hyprland dotfiles** — made with love, curiosity,  
and a beginner’s determination to make Linux look *kawaii & comfy*. (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ♡

This repo is my little learning garden 🌱 where I grow my ricing skills,  
customize things slowly, and try not to bork my system too much (lol).

## 🌈 My Ricing Philosophy ~  
> “Your desktop should make you smile every time you see it.”  
> — me (and probably some anime character somewhere)

I’m learning by tweaking little by little —  
every improvement = +1 XP to my ricing skill tree. 🎮✨
